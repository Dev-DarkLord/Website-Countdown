# Countdown Timer
This is a simple countdown timer project built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to set a specific future date and time, and then displays the remaining time in days, hours, minutes, and seconds until that date and time is reached.

## How to Use
To use this countdown timer, simply clone this repository or download the source code files. Then, open the index.html file in your web browser. You will see a countdown timer displayed on the page, along with input fields for setting the future date and time you want to countdown to.

To set the countdown date and time, simply fill out the form with the desired date and time. Once you submit the form, the timer will begin counting down to that date and time.

## Customization
This countdown timer can be easily customized to fit your needs. You can change the colors and styles of the timer display by editing the CSS code in the style.css file. You can also modify the JavaScript code in the script.js file to change the countdown date or add additional functionality.
